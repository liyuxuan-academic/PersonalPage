== About me
I reciced my B.Eng degree in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Science and Technology of China([http://en.ustc.edu.cn USTC]) in 2021, where I worked with [http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jianmin/ Prof. Jianmin Ji]. 
I also recieved a minor of Talent Program in Liberal Arts and Science from USTC in 2021.
I went to the University of Alberta in September, 2021, where I was a Master of Science student in Computing Science, supervised by Matt Taylor as a member of [https://irll.ca IRL Lab], [http://rlai.ualberta.ca RLAI Lab] and [http://amii.ca Amii].
I am a PhD student of University of Waterloo, supervised by Prof. Victor Zhong in [https://r2llab.com R2L Lab] and [https://vectorinstitute.ai Vector Institute].
